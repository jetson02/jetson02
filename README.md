- 👋 Hi, I’m @jetson02
- 👀 I’m interested in python & cyber security
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, linux, cyber security
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a home safety program that will detect the MACs & as much info as possible of devices (phones) within my wifi 5G range and will notify me
- It would need a tool to add NACs to exception lists such as family devices, and possible more frequent notify if it doesn't go away or gets closer.
- This could serve to grab a NAC addy & phone type that broke into your house or car at night
- Just one more simple thing that help if you dont have security cameras.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
