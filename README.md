- 👋 Hi, I’m @jetson02
- 👀 I’m interested in python & cyber security
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, linux, cyber security
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a program that will detect the MACs within my wifi 5g range 
(monitor who came on property as most phones have wifi on always try to connect)
 a beep would be nice. And an exception list would be nice for my own devices and possibly neighbours,
 if I keep getting the same Mac beeping at 9am when they leave the house.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
